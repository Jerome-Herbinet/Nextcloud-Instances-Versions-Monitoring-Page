## Restrictions : 
This program does not work : 
- with "hidden" Nextcloud instances (and therefore only accessible via a VPN, for example)
- with Nextcloud instances whose access to status.php has been blocked.
- with Owncloud instances (may work partially because of a small field label difference in the status.php file). See developpment roadmap.

## Installation : 
1. Upload all the files behind a regular web environment and "https://..." URL. All is static, so you don't need any database.
2. Inside the index.php file, fill out the Nextcloud instances domains list and the additionnal major Nextcloud version + EOL date, if missing. You can also change wordings with better ones or you can simply translate them.

## Developpent roadmap : 
- Better UI
- Responsive design
- Owncloud compatibility
